# Honeypot Assignment

**Time spent:** **X** hours spent in total

**Objective:** Create a honeynet using MHN-Admin. Present your findings as if you were requested to give a brief report of the current state of Internet security. Assume that your audience is a current employer who is questioning why the company should allocate anymore resources to the IT security team.

### MHN-Admin Deployment (Required)

The MHN-Admin Vm was deployed from the command line of the local host machine. GCP was used to implement. The state of internet security is minimal. The network was exposed to 4,000 + threats within less than 24 hours.

**Summary:** How did you deploy it? Did you use GCP, AWS, Azure, Vagrant, VirtualBox, etc.?
